<h1> Three Website Ideas</h1>

<hr />

<h3>Video Game Reviews</h3>
<p>Breaking down a video game's plot summary and mechanics, and discussing wether or not these elements work together to make a complete and satisfying product. <br />
While the website would be info-heavy, the tone would be personal and friendly, like someone you know explaining a video game they just played to you.<br />
Website designed akin to game review websites like IGN.<br />

<hr />

<h3>Art Portfolio</h3>
<p>Website gallery of past digital works, grouped by year made. <br /> 
Information would include Title, aspect ratio, and what platform the content was created in.<br />
Professional tone, but aesthetically artistic with personal touch.<br />
