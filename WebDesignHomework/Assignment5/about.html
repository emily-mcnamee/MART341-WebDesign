<h1>Brief Explanations to my website ideas</h1>

<hr />

<h3>Video Game Reviews</h3>
<p>I really enjoy going through video game sites and reading what people think of the releases, and making my own would be good practice on coding multiple<br/>
visual designs into one webpage. It also be good practice in linking multiple pages together, creating cohesion in the graphics, and finding out my preferred<br />
color pallets. I think it would also be fun to write out my personal experiences with the game for others to read and make their own decisions about the game</p>

<h3>Art Porfolio</h3>
<p>As I already have a large backlog of past digital projects, it would be good practice to learn how to create a personalized website for my projects.<br />
Having all of my projects in one place along with descriptions of the works would be helpful for when I'm submitting portfolios to jobs.<br />
I can focus on page design and making sure everything fits well onto the page, creating a gallery feel to the webpage</p>

<h3>Landscape/Indoor Plant Blog</h3>
<p>Indoor plant care is one of my hobbies, so I'd a place to record everything I've grown and what problems I encountered.<br />
I think it would be fun to include photos of the succulent pots I've grown, with listings of what's growing in the pot and specific care instructions.<br />
There's a lot of gardening blogs out there but mainly focus on outdoor plant care. I like the idea of a website that has a "cottagecore" theme to it but specifially for indoor plant care.</p>
