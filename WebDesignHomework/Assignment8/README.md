<h2>Elements used for this assignment:</h2>
<ul>
   <li>DIV</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Navigation Bar divs - 3 unique divs total &#40;navbar, container, navbar-collapse&#41;</li>
    <li>Email form container - 2 unique divs total &#40;container + email input form&#41;</li>
    </ul>
     <p>Customized div containers, including the variables: container, container-fluid, form-group, and row. Placing the individual media elements into their own custom containers allowed for further customization such as borders, ratios, and the ability to organize the elements in a more flexible way.</p>
   <li>SPAN</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Button appearance for navbar dropdown toggle &#40;&lt;span class&#61;"navbar-toggler-icon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#41;</li>
    <li>text span classes "text-center" and data-bs-theme="dark"</li>
    <li>Custom css style sheet containing most of the span class changes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Most of my span class editing is in the mainstyle.css sheet inside the styles folder. To make the text more accessible, I used a sans serif font with an off-white color font to minimize eye strain. The font sizes are also enlarged to maximize readability. To customize further, I would find a different header font to make the headers pop out more, but for now their larger size is adequate.</p>
   <li>AUDIO</li>
    <ul>
    <li>"Joy of the Nords"</li>
    <li>"Oscillator Song"</li>
    <p>I found some helpful bootstrap guides on how I could place the two audio files side-by-side to keep up the style of the rest of the website.</p>
    </ul>
   <li>IFRAME</li>
    <ul>
    <li>TouchDesigner Video</li>
    <li>Adobe After Effects Videos 2-4</li>
    <p>I organized the videos into two x two columns to maximize space usage and for the webpage's style to follow similarly to the rest of the website. Unfortunetly, due to the four videos size all being quite large, I decided it would be best for all four videos to be iframes. The page already takes a bit longer to load than I would like.</p>
    </ul>
   <li>CLASS</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Bootstrap div and span classes for navbar</li>
    <li>Boostrap div and span classes for image containers</li>
    <li>Boostrap div and span classes for email form</li>
    <li>Bootstrap div and span classes for voting forms</li>
    <li>Bootstrap div and span classes for iframes and audio</li>
    <li>Custom class style for hr tags</li>
    <p>It was very important to me that almost all of the media within my website followed bootstrap's customization to stick to a style.<br> To make the website more accessible, I added alt text to all of the images, and ARIA descriptions inside the videos and audio files. The subscribe and navbar buttons are hover-sensitive, as well as all links being underlined to highlight the interactive elements of the page. The background is also a dark grey; the color being a customized variable from bootstrap.<br> Page headers have also been customized to better stylistically fit into the rest of the webpage. If I wanted to go even further, I would also look into finding out how to code in a light to dark mode toggle button on the top of the screen.
    </ul>
   <li>ESCAPE CHARA</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Replaced text parentheses with their escape characters</li>
    <li>Replaced text quotations with their escape characters</li>
    <p>This replacement is just to secure that the webpage would not confuse the captions of images and video as html coding.</p>
    </ul>
