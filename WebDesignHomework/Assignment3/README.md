  - Installing extensions within Studio Visual Code
     1. Installed Yiyi Wang's **Markdown Preview Enhanced** *v0.8.14*
     2. Installed **file-icons**
     3. I am currently using teabyii's **Ayu Dark Bordered** *v1.0.5* as my VS code Theme
     4. By the way, Atom was sunsetted in 2022, making it incompatible with the most recent versions of VS Code
   
        
  - Learning the differences between editing repositories from Github Browser mode and via VS Code
  - First created the README Markdown file within Assignment3, then followed the steps of the tutorial, creating the new project [assignment-03] within my local document folder "Github", then uploading the folder into the root directory of MART341-WebDesign.
