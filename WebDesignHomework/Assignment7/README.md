<h2>Website Highlights</h2>

  <p>I'm personally very happy with how I managed to implement bootstrap into my website, and figuring out how to create the navigation bar is definitely my personal favorite part of my website due to the attention I put into trying to learn how to code one into the site. The people who commented on my discussion mentioned to make sure that the organization is wel put together, and someone also recommended to put borders around my images; so I made sure that those elements were correctly implemented into my webpage. </p>

  <p>Going through the bootstrap guide and figuring out how to use its customized elements was genuinely fun for me to go through, and while I did have some difficulties in the beginning trying to figure out how to coorectly link it into the webpage, when I started getting a good grasp on the css I started enjoying the process. I will probably continue working on this website outside of this class's homework; though I'm unsure if I will ever actually actively use it outside of coding projects, I think its well worth the effort to keep working on my website coding using this as a template. It would also be a good for me to continually add more art I have in my portfolio into the site, if only to help practive heirarchy and balance to my webpage. If I am to continue my art implementing, I think there would be a max of four columns with rows below them would be best for balance and organization.</p>
