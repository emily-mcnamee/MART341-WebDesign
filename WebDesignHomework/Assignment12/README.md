# HTML Page For this Project: 'Quinn's Art Gallery' Page 2 (Assignment 7 page2.html)

## Copied over Assignment 10's index.html and mainstyle.css to carry over custom classes and help unify the two pages' looks

* Sizing – Control the width and height of elements on the page.
* Overflow – Manage how content is displayed when it exceeds the element’s boundaries.
* Border – Define and style borders around elements for emphasis or separation.
* Margin – Adjust the space outside an element, creating separation from other elements.
* Padding – Set the space inside an element, between its content and border.
* Display: Inline / Inline-block – Specify how elements are displayed in relation to others.
* Dropdown – Create a dropdown menu for navigation or content organization.
* Position – Control the placement of elements with properties like absolute, relative, or fixed.
