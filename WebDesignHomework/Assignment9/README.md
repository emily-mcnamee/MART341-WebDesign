# How to make a "Nature-Covered" succulent arrangement pot using recycled and cheap materials

## Materials Needed:
- Tough cutting tool, such as a boxcutter or durable scissors
- Any plastic gallon container &#40;clear plastic is personally used, but opaque plastic works as well&#41;, such as a used milk jug or water gallon jug
- supply of "nature" scrapbooking supplies; You can find a colorful selection of natural decorations at your local art supply store that sells letter and scrapbooking decorations. At least two packs of each selection is recommended for full coverage.
Note: using genuine foliage isn't recommended as they will naturally mold and break down over time
- Hot glue gun and lots of extra hot gluing sticks!
- handful of small and cute rocks &#40;<s>optional</s> required! :&#41; &#32;&#41;
- Succlent-specific soil; either hand made or store-bought
- Optional: Wood burning tool &#40;used to create smooth edges and to easily poke holes&#41;
