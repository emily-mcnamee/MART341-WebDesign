# How to Create an "Overgrown" Naturalistic Succulent Arrangement Using Recycled and Inexpensive Materials

## Materials Needed:
- A plastic gallon container (clear or opaque plastic works well), such as a used milk or water jug
- Dried and preserved plants, including moss (available at most art supply stores)
- Scissors or a box cutter
- Marker
- Tissue paper
- Hot glue gun and extra glue sticks
- A handful of small decorative rocks (required for flair!)
- Succulent-specific soil (homemade or store-bought)
- Optional: Wood burning tool (for smoothing edges and making drainage holes)

## Instructions:

### Step 1: Set Up Your Workspace
- Clear a work area and place a mat underneath for protection.
- Plug in the hot glue gun and place it on a heat-resistant plate.
- Keep all your materials within easy reach.

### Step 2: Mark the Cutting Areas
- Lay the plastic container horizontally and use the marker to outline where you want to cut.
- Plan to remove about 1/3 of the container, leaving 2/3 intact for ample plant space. (Refer to pictures for guidance.)
- For milk jugs, cutting out the side with the handle provides better balance.
- Mark four small dots on the opposite side to create drainage holes.

### Step 3: Cut the Container
- Carefully cut along the marked lines, going slowly for precision.
- Make sure to create drainage holes where you marked them.
- Optional: Use a wood burning tool or hot metal tool to smooth edges and make drainage holes more easily.

### Step 4: Wrap the Container with Tissue Paper
- Lay a sheet of tissue paper under the container to provide a surface for the glue to adhere to.
- Fold the tissue paper around the container's edges, 
- With the side edges, fold the tissue paper over itself instead of into the container; the second layer will provide extra support (Use picture for reference)
- Hot glue tissue paper to the container

### Step 5: Remove Excess Tissue Paper
- Tear or trim the tissue paper from the bottom to avoid blocking the drainage holes.
- Carefully remove or cut away any excess tissue paper around the container’s mouth and sides.
- Glue down any loose edges for a clean, secure finish.

### Step 6: Add the Decorative Moss and Plants
- Begin hot-gluing preserved moss and dried plant material onto the tissue paper.
- For best results, apply the materials in a checkerboard pattern to create contrast. (Refer to pictures for visual help.)
- Use the tissue paper as a guide to fill in empty spots.
- Play with texture and volume—squish some sections and let others hang off the edges for a natural, "overgrown" look.
- Let your creativity flow and have fun experimenting with different arrangements!

### Step 7: Add Soil and Decorative Rocks
- Fill the container with succulent-specific soil.
- Place small decorative rocks on top to help stabilize the soil and add a touch of style.

### Step 8: Final Touches and Enjoy!
- Admire your creation and take a few photos to show off your work.
- Add succulents if desired for a lush, finished look.
